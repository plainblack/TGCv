# Jobs
Ving uses a jobs server called [BullMQ](http://bullmq.io) to execute potentially long running asynchronous background jobs. 


## Setting Up Redis
To use the jobs system you must first have a Redis server. Then you simply need to add an entry in .env that points to your Redis server like so:

```bash
VING_REDIS="redis://@localhost:6379"
```

You can include a username and password in the URL like so:

```bash
VING_REDIS="redis://user:pass@localhost:6379"
```

**NOTE:** You must enable the setting `maxmemory-policy=noeviction` in your Redis server to prevent it from automatically deleting keys when memory runs low as this will cause problems with the BullMQ system.

## Enqueueing Jobs
To enqueue a job you'd use the following code.

```js
import ving from '#ving/index.mjs';

ving.addJob('Test', { foo: 'bar' }, { delay: 1000 * 60 });
```
That would run a handler called `Test` with the parameter of `{ foo: 'bar' }`, but first it would wait 60 seconds before the job would be run.

You can also enqueue jobs from the [CLI](cli).

```bash
./ving.mjs jobs --addJob Test --jobData '{ "foo": "bar" }'
```

## Running Jobs
Jobs are run by job workers using handlers. The job worker system is run via the [CLI](cli).

```bash
./ving.mjs jobs --worker --ttl 60
```

The above would run a worker for 60 seconds afterwhich the worker would shut down. If you want to run it indefinitely just leave the `ttl` off.

## Job Handlers
At the heart of the jobs system are handlers. Handlers are custom code that knows how to process a job. You can find handlers in the `#ving/jobs/handlers` folder. This is what a simple handler looks like:

```js
import ving from '#ving/index.mjs';

export default async function (job) {
    ving.log('jobs').debug(`Test ran with data: ${JSON.stringify(job.data)}`);
    return true;
}
```

The handler's job is to do whatever needs to be done with `job.data` to complete the job. It should return `true` when done, or `throw` an [ouch](utils) if it fails. 

To create a new job run:

```bash
./ving.mjs jobs -n MyNewHandler
```
