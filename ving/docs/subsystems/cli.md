# CLI

The CLI or Command Line Interface allows you to perform administrative and development functions quickly and easily. 

You access it from your project root like this:

```bash
./ving.mjs --help
```

You can explore what commands are available by using the above command. It has a built-in help system to tell you how to use the commands.

To get help on a specific command, like user management, you can type:

```bash
./ving.mjs user --help
```
