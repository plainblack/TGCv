# S3File
S3File is the file upload system of Ving. 

The process of uploading a file happens in 3 steps:

- Get a presigned URL for S3
- Upload to S3
- Post back to import the file for use on some other Ving Record

Here's a bit more detail:

```
Browser / Your Code --> POST filename and content type to /api/v1/s3file 
                            * creates an S3File and sets its status to pending
                            * generates a Presigned URL for S3
                    <-- Return S3File description, including meta.presignedUrl

                    --> PUT s3file.meta.presignedUrl
                            * stores file in S3
                    <-- Return nothing

                    --> PUT s3file.props.id to an import API such as /api/v1/user/:id/import-avatar
                            * post processes the file uploaded to S3
                            * verifies that the file conforms to the import rules
                    <-- Return updated record such as User
```

## Endpoints

### List

```
GET /api/v1/s3file
```

### Create
```
POST /api/v1/s3file
```
You won't actually post the file here. You post the `filename`, `contentType`, and `sizeInBytes` here and it will return a `presignedUrl` in the `meta` section.
