## manifest.json

You can edit the `manifest.json` file in the `/public` folder of your project so that your app/site can be saved as an app on devices like the iPhone and Android. It will also be used by the [Web Share API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/share).

## Global Meta Tags and Favicons

You can add global meta tags to your site in `nuxt.config.mjs`.
